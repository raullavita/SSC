# SSC Roadmap — single source of truth

**Updated:** 2026-06-24 (contact graph privacy · unified identity · Engine 10 desktop)
**Repo:** `C:\Users\smash\SSC-main`  
**Rule:** After every engine step, feature, or deploy — update **this file only**. Do not maintain parallel roadmaps.

**Gate commands:** `backend/scripts/run_engineN_gate.py`  
**Security model:** `memory/SECURITY_MODEL.md`

## Signal coverage — whole app plan

**Your question:** Signal was added — shouldn't the **whole app** use it?

**Answer:** Yes, that is the **target**. Engine 8 v1 deliberately shipped **incrementally** so nothing broke. Current truth:

| Surface | Android | Windows/Mac desktop | Browser (dev only) |
|---------|---------|---------------------|-------------------|
| 1:1 text | ✅ `signal_v1` | ✅ `signal_v1` | Legacy RSA (not product) |
| 1:1 call signaling | ✅ encrypted | ✅ encrypted | Legacy |
| 1:1 attachments | ✅ `signal_v1` | ✅ `signal_v1` | Legacy RSA |
| Group messages | ✅ `signal_group_v1` | ✅ `signal_group_v1` | Legacy RSA |
| Group call signaling | ✅ encrypted | ✅ encrypted | Legacy |
| Stories / statuses | ✅ `signal_status_v1` | ✅ `signal_status_v1` | Legacy RSA |
| Account unlock | RSA vault (PBKDF2) | Same | Same |

**Product surfaces:** Android APK · Windows `.exe` · Mac `.dmg` (build on Mac) · iOS deferred.

**P1 security — complete:**
1. [x] **Unified identity** — libsignal curve primary (`memory/UNIFIED_IDENTITY_CHARTER.md`)
2. [x] **Contacts graph privacy** — blind seals + encrypted rosters (`memory/CONTACT_GRAPH_PRIVACY_CHARTER.md`)

Details: `memory/SECURITY_MODEL.md`

## Testing & deploy (founder — locked)

| Mode | Use |
|------|-----|
| LAN / localhost | Founder laptop only |
| **Firebase App Distribution** | Real testers — production API URL in APK |
| **Cloud Run HTTPS** | `https://ssc-api-4jp3wuccwa-ew.a.run.app` |
| LAN IP | **Never** give to testers |

```powershell
cd C:\Users\smash\SSC-main\backend
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\run_engine8_gate.py
.\venv\Scripts\python.exe scripts\run_engine9_gate.py
```

## Remaining work (priority order)

### P0 — Before wider testers
- [x] HTTPS production API (Cloud Run)
- [x] Google OAuth + Cloud Run redirect URI
- [x] APK bakes Cloud Run URL (`yarn cap:sync` / `SSC-BUILD-APK.bat`)
- [x] **Redeploy** latest `main` + `CONTACT_GRAPH_PEPPER` in `cloud_run.env` (revision `ssc-api-00005-x8s` · 24 Jun 2026)
- [ ] Custom domain + Turnstile (~28 Jun)
- [x] Sync PRD (`memory/PRD.md` — 24 Jun 2026, incl. deploy checklist)
- [x] Automated smoke: `e2e_smoke.py` + Engine 1–5/8/9 gates + production `/api/health` (24 Jun 2026)
- [x] Settings Security hub + 2FA wired (`SettingsModal` + `TwoFAModal`)
- [x] First-run onboarding coach (3 steps)
- [ ] Two-phone smoke: Signal chat + call + on-device translate (founder manual — APK on device)
- [ ] TURN verification on cellular/Wi‑Fi mix (founder manual — same session as two-phone)
- [ ] Reset 3 tester accounts after production redeploy (unified identity)

### P1 — Product / security
- [x] Engine 8.9: Signal attachments (1:1 Android)
- [x] Engine 8.11: Group Sender Keys

- [x] Engine 10: Windows + Mac desktop (`memory/DESKTOP_CLIENT_CHARTER.md`)
- [x] Unified identity (libsignal curve primary · prekeys required · `run_unified_identity_gate.py`)
- [x] Web/PWA product retired — browser shows download-only landing; chat/register gated
- [x] Contacts graph privacy (blind seals + encrypted rosters · `run_contacts_graph_gate.py`)
- [x] AGPL legal review (`memory/AGPL_COMPLIANCE.md`, `LICENSE`, in-app source offer)
- [x] Group video cap **8** (mesh; SFU for 9+ deferred to domain ~28 Jun)

### P2 — Scale & polish
- [x] Engine 6 evaluation (push + own-metal — charter + gate; migration deferred)
- [x] WebSocket Redis pub-sub (multi-worker — Redis fan-out + global online set)
- [x] SFU Phase A — charter + `/api/config` + mesh cap enforcement (mediasoup deploy = Phase B)
- [x] iOS Capacitor scaffold (`cap add ios` + charter; App Store build deferred — needs Mac)
- [x] 2FA backup codes (10 codes on setup, login fallback, regenerate in UI)
- [x] Invite links — **retired** (username search + friend requests sufficient)
- [x] Frontend automated tests (`yarn test:ci` — 13 tests, 4 suites)
- [x] Remove dead shadcn `components/ui` scaffold
